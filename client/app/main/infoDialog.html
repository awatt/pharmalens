        <h4>Diabetes Mellitus in the U.S.</h4>
        <p>
          In September of 2014, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) went live with Open Payments[url: https://www.cms.gov/openpayments/]: a web-portal hosting robust nationwide data on the financial relationships between prescribing physicians and the pharmaceutical, biologic and medical device industries.
        </p>

        <p>The source data was provided by the drug and device manufacturers, pursuant to new disclosure requirements enacted under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act (“Sunshine Act”) provision of the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”).  Starting in mid-2013 and going forward, the Open Payments database includes data on, among other things, payments to prescribing doctors and teaching hospitals in the form of gifts, meals or drug samples; compensation for doctors’ services as speakers, educators or authors of industry-produced drug-studies; and, research grants to teaching hospital physicians.</p>

        <p>The Sunshine Act embodies the growing pubic awareness of the conflicts of interest produced by these financial relationships.  In 2009, the National Academy of Medicine (NAM), reported data suggesting “that these relationships may influence physicians to prescribe a company’s medicines even when evidence indicates another drug would be more beneficial.” (url: http://iom.nationalacademies.org/Reports/2009/Conflict-of-Interest-in-Medical-Research-Education-and-Practice.aspx)  The NAM report urged greater transparency and recommended “eliminating these problematic relationships between physicians and industry.”</p>

        <p>While Open Payments is a major step towards transparency, a recent University of Colorado study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found “negligible to small” deterrence effect of the disclosure laws on physicians’ prescribing habits.  Among the researchers’ speculative reasons for the small effect was the fact that “although these payments were disclosed to state agencies, payment information was not disseminated to the public in an accessible way.”  [url: http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1170047]</p>

        <p>PharmLens is designed to enhance transparency and public accessibility to this critical information, using the tools of data visualization.</p>
